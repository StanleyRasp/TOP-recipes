    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div class="indent-1">
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Tomato Paste</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Pepperoni Sausage</li>
            <li>Oregano</li>
            <li>Dried Basil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Wheat flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; <br/>set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste .</li>
            <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the <br/>water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough <br/>remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
            <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. <br/>Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRiseÂ® Yeast, let dough rest, covered, <br/>for 10 minutes.)</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased <br/>pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
            <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, <br/>rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
        </ol>
